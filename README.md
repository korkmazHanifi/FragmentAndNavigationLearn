//This app takes a name from the user and displays it on a second page.

It achieves this with the help of fragments and navigation graphs.

In the first fragment we get a name from the user.

When the user types the name and clicks the button, we move to the second fragment and print this name on the screen.

The navigation chart I use

!The application is a basic level application, but it is a building block for my other projects.
